# SWE442-Project
# SWE 442 - Java Degree Calculator Project

This repository has a simple Java software created as part of the SWE 442 course project.  
The goal of this project is to demonstrate the use of Git and GitHub to control the release, including branching, merging, and tagging.

The program calculates the student's total score and average based on the input scores of the test, midterm exam, and final exam.  
It also includes input validation to prevent entering negative values.

 üìÑ Project Description

The Java program is a command-line application that asks the user to enter the student's name and grades for:

- Test (out of 10)  
- Midterm (out of 30)  
- Final Exam (out of 60)

After entering the grades, the program:

- Verifies that all grades are non-negative  
- Calculates the total score out of 100  
- Calculates the average score  
- Displays the final letter grade (A, B, C, D, or F)

 Features Implemented

- Input Validation:  
  Ensures that users cannot enter negative values for any grade.

- Average Calculation:  
  Calculates the average of the test, midterm, and final exam scores.
